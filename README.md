# Welcome to my personal page!

This is a simple project to serve as a personal page for me, and to have a place to store all the info about my course.

Here you will find a brief introduction about the course, a list showing the classes schedule for today, and some links and information.

## About me

I am a Data Science student, interested in Web Development, and in the process of becoming a full-stack developer.

I have been working on web development for over 4 and a half years now, and I really enjoy it. I am always looking for new challenges and ways to improve my skills.

I am also interested in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, and in the process of learning more about it.
